Data Cleaning Scripts for Efficient Preprocessing in Python â€“ Includes Pandas and NumPy implementations.
# Data Cleaning in Python

## Overview
This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook (`data_cleaning.ipynb`)** that demonstrates essential **data cleaning** techniques using **Pandas** and **NumPy**. It helps preprocess raw datasets by handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and performing basic data transformations.

## Features
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputation, dropping, or filling missing values.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Identifying and removing duplicate records.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Ensuring consistency in column data types.
- **Outlier Detection & Treatment**: Using statistical methods.
- **Data Standardization**: Formatting categorical and numerical data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Basic visualizations and summaries.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed along with the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
